kgrid
=====

Calculates a suitably tight k-point grid for quantum chemistry calculations.

Current status
--------------

* Acts on FHI-aims geometry.in file in the working directory
* Target length cutoff of 10AA is coded into program
* K-point density is selected to satisfy this length cutoff, as described by Moreno & Soler (1992)[1]
* Returns k-grid to standard output

Short-term goals
----------------

* Take input file and length cutoff as optional arguments
* Default to working directory and 10AA (standard for Walsh Materials Design group)
* Support for VASP (delegated to Lee Burton)

Long-term goals
---------------

* Generate suitable input files directly
    * This may involve integrating this script into a larger, more general program

Disclaimer
----------

This program is not affiliated with FHI-aims. You are welcome to use it and build on it, but do so at your own risk.
